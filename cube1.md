Cube27 organizes its approach to global digital transformations around a Global Capability Center (GCC) model and several specialized technical pillars designed to support enterprise and open-source ecosystems.
The core service frameworks defining this approach include:
• Integrated Digital Services: The company structures its digital capabilities into six primary areas: eCommerce solutions, AI & Rapid Product Development, Engineering & Development Services, Cloud & DevOps, Analytics & AI, and Process Automation.
• eCommerce & CMS Segmentation: The framework categorizes implementations into two distinct tracks:
    ◦ Enterprise Platforms: Utilizing high-level systems such as Salesforce Commerce Cloud (Demandware), SAP Commerce Cloud (Hybris), and Magento Commerce.
    ◦ OpenSource Platforms: Deploying agile solutions like WooCommerce, Shopify, Magento, and PrestaShop.
    ◦ These services encompass architecture, deployment, and complex migrations, including work for Fortune 500 clients.
• Marketing Technology (MarTech) & Intelligence: This framework focuses on data connectivity and optimization through:
    ◦ Integrations: Connecting analytics (Google Analytics, Tealium), APIs (Adwords, Facebook), and CRMs (Oracle Eloqua, Adobe Marketing Cloud).
    ◦ Proprietary Tools: Leveraging internal solutions like DSMM Advantage for campaign management and AQ360 for dynamic call tracking.
    ◦ Business Intelligence Stack: Using a technical stack that includes ETL tools (SSIS, AWS Lambda), data warehousing (Snowflake, Amazon Redshift), and advanced analysis via machine learning.
• Mobile & Web Architecture: The approach utilizes modern frameworks such as Angular, ReactJS, and Node JS, alongside mobile-specific technologies like Flutter and React Native. This includes the development of Progressive Web Apps (PWA) and Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP).
• Global Operational Infrastructure: The service delivery is supported by a 24/7 availability model across NORAM, EMEA, APAC, and India, ensuring continuous global support. This operational framework targets high efficiency (10% YoY improvement) and rapid resource onboarding (6 weeks
