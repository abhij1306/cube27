Case Study 1: Scaling Feednomics (GCC & Operations)
Title: Establishing a High-Performance India Operation for Feednomics.
The Challenge: Feednomics required a rapid expansion of their operational capabilities but needed to ensure the new team maintained the specific technical quality and cultural alignment of their US headquarters.
The Solution (The Cube27 Approach):
• GCC Setup: Cube27 initiated a "Build-Operate" model, handling the legal entity setup, infrastructure, and compliance.
• Stringent Hiring: Executed a rigorous recruitment drive to build a full team of contractors, screening for both technical aptitude in data handling and cultural fit.
• Culture Mirroring: Implemented HR operations that mirrored Feednomics' internal values, ensuring the India team operated as a seamless extension of the US entity.
The Result:
• Seamless Integration: A fully operational team functioning as dedicated contractors.
• Stability: High retention rates (<10% attrition) ensured knowledge continuity.
• Scale: Successfully scaled the team to support global operations 24/7.

Case Study 2: Supplier ERP Solution (Digital Transformation)
Title: End-to-End PO, Challan, & Invoice System for Manufacturing Suppliers.
The Challenge: A major supplier faced inefficiencies in managing the Purchase Order (PO) to Payment lifecycle. Manual Excel-based invoicing (generating documents without database tracking) led to errors and made historical data analysis impossible.
The Solution:
• Custom Development: Developed a bespoke web-based ERP system using Angular and Node JS.
• Workflow Automation: Created a "PO-Challan-Invoice-SRV" workflow. The system automatically converts POs into Challans and subsequently into Invoices, ensuring data consistency.
• MAT COD Column Integration: Integrated specific "MAT COD" columns in the invoice generation module to align with industry-standard Excel formats.
• Historical Intelligence: Built a data warehouse layer allowing the supplier to analyze historical trends, pricing history, and volume metrics instantly.
The Result:
• Digital Traceability: 100% digitization of the document trail.
• Analytics Ready: Transformed static documents into dynamic data assets using BI visualization tools.
