Cube27 Brand Guidelines
Version: 1.0 Core Theme: Stability. Intelligence. Scale.
1. Brand Identity & Positioning
The Core Promise
Cube27 is not just a dev shop; it is a Global Capability Center (GCC) partner. We bridge the gap between operational stability and high-end technical innovation. We do not sell "hours"; we sell "outcomes" and "extended teams."
Tagline
Primary: "Powered by People. Enabled by Tech." Secondary: "Stability. Intelligence. Scale."
Brand Archetype
• The Architect (Structure/Stability): We build systems that last, from GCC teams to ERP architectures.
• The Sage (Intelligence/Expertise): We rely on deep technical knowledge (20+ years of leadership experience) rather than buzzwords.
Target Audience
• Primary: C-Suite (CTOs, CIOs) of Fortune 500s and high-growth enterprises (e.g., Dell, Ford, Arrow Electronics).
• Secondary: VPs of Engineering needing rapid scaling (onboarding in < 6 weeks).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Voice & Tone Guidelines
Our voice is:
• Authoritative but Accessible: We use specific technical terms correctly (e.g., "React Native," "Snowflake," "Hybris") but explain the business value clearly.
• Data-Driven: We back claims with metrics. We don't say "we are fast"; we say "95% SLA for enterprise support".
• Human-Centric: We emphasize the "People" aspect—our stringent hiring, culture mirroring, and <10% attrition rate.

3. Visual & Content Pillars (The Quad-Pillar Strategy)
To ensure "Brand Clarity," all content must fall into one of four distinct pillars.

Pillar 1: GCC-as-a-Service (Operational Excellence)
• Focus: Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model for global teams.
• Key Concepts: Culture Mirroring, IP Protection, 90-Day Startup.
• Proof Points: <10% attrition; 150+ team members.

Pillar 2: Salesforce & Enterprise Platforms (Platforms)
• Focus: Summit-level CRM implementation and custom Agentforce agents.
• Key Concepts: RevOps Architecture, ERP Integration (SAP/Oracle), Salesforce Commerce.
• Tech: Agentforce, MuleSoft, SAP Hybris.

Pillar 3: Digital Product & Commerce (Engineering)
• Focus: Composable commerce and conversion-native UX.
• Key Concepts: Product-First Discovery, AI-Accelerated Delivery.
• Proprietary Tools: AQ360 Tech Audit, DSMM Advantage.
• Tech: Node.js, Go, Python, AWS/Azure, Docker/K8s.

Pillar 4: Agentic AI & Automation (Future)
• Focus: LLM-driven autonomous agents and process automation.
• Key Concepts: Agentic Checkout, PO-Challan-Invoice reconciliation.
• Tech: Python, PyTorch, OpenAI, LangChain.

4. Writing for Web: Stylistic Rules
1. The "Tech Stack" Rule
Never mention a service without citing the underlying technology. This proves competence.
• Bad: "We do mobile apps."
• Good: "Mobile architecture utilizing Flutter and React Native for cross-platform deployment."
• Bad: "We do data analysis."
• Good: "Advanced ETL workflows using AWS Lambda and SSIS, integrated with Snowflake or Google Big Query."
2. The "Case Study" Structure
Every case study must follow the Challenge -> Solution -> Result format to respect the reader's time.
• Example (from user history):
    ◦ Challenge: Manual Excel invoicing lacked historical data tracking.
    ◦ Solution: Developed a Node JS/Angular ERP with a "PO-Challan-Invoice" workflow and specific MAT COD Column integration.
    ◦ Result: 100% digitization and real-time historical analytics.
3. No "Fluff" Metrics
Use the specific operational metrics found in our internal data:
• Efficiency: "10% YoY improvement".
• Speed: "Resource onboarding in 6 weeks".
• Reliability: "24/7 support across NORAM, EMEA, APAC, and India".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Visual Identity (Web & Collateral)
• Primary Logo:
    ◦ The "3D Glass Cube": A premium, isometric 3D cube with "C27" integrated into its faces.
    ◦ Usage: Must appear on all digital headers and footer. Represents the "stability" of the cube matched with the "intelligence" of the design.
• Imagery Style:
    ◦ The Split: To visualize "Powered by People, Enabled by Tech," use split-screen compositions. One side features warm, human photography (teams collaborating); the other side features cool, precise data visualizations or code overlays.
    ◦ Authenticity: Avoid generic stock photos of "people shaking hands." Use images that imply work—whiteboarding, coding, analyzing screens.
• Iconography:
    ◦ Use thin-line, technical icons for services (e.g., a server rack for DevOps, a cart for eCommerce).
    ◦ Background Icons: Use subtle, large background icons (opacity 0.05) behind service cards for texture.

6. Leadership Profiling
When presenting the company, leverage the specific pedigree of the leadership to build immediate trust.
• Arpan Jain (CEO): Highlight "20+ years in eCommerce & Product Implementation" and "B. Tech in Computer Science". This signals that the CEO is a technologist, not just a salesperson.
• Amber Jain (CTO): Highlight "24+ years as Digital Marketing Technologist" and "MS in Computer Science from USC". This signals academic and practical rigor.
